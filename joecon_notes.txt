- Allow strings to be marked as safe for certain contexts
    - Marking is currently done by storing taint flag (unsigned int) in memory immediately after the string value of zvals

- Get string representation of arbitrary zvals (not just strings), as they will be printed out
	- DONE

- Determine best method for modifying zval before it is echo'd
    - Done, but need to fix memory leaks
